# 🚀 Monad Volume Bot in Rust 🦀

## 🌟 Overview: Precision Volume Bot with Functional Architecture

Monad Volume Bot is a real-time analytics tool that tracks trading volume changes and detects sudden spikes in activity across the Monad ecosystem. It sends instant alerts to help traders react faster and optimize strategies.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Monadic Control Flow (ROP):** Operations return `MResult<T>`, allowing clean, traceable failure propagation and simplified debugging.
* **Secure API Handling:** Placeholder logic for HMAC-SHA256 signature generation for secure private API calls.
* **Risk Management:** Fixed-fractional position sizing based on configurable risk-per-trade parameters and signal strength.
* **State Machine:** Finite State Machine manages lifecycle (`Initializing`, `Syncing`, `Trading`, `Paused`).
* **Performance Metrics:** Tracks trades executed, total volume, and uptime.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The engine consists of five interconnected modules:

1. **`monad.rs`** – Functional core defining `MResult<T>` and `Bind` trait for pipeline composition.
2. **`exchange.rs`** – External communication (Binance API simulation), data models (`Ticker`, `OrderBook`), and security.
3. **`trader.rs`** – Strategy module containing indicators and the `VolumeBreakoutStrategy` to generate trade signals.
4. **`bot.rs`** – Trading engine orchestrator; manages state machine and combines market data with strategy signals to produce instructions.
5. **`main.rs`** – Entry point; loads configuration and runs the event loop.

**Example pipeline in `bot.rs`:**

```rust
let pipeline = self.client.fetch_ticker(&symbol)
    .bind(|ticker| match self.strategy.process_tick(&ticker) { /* ... */ })
    .bind(|(ticker, signal)| self.risk_manager.calculate_entry(signal, &balance, ticker.price))
    .bind(|instruction| self.execute_instruction(instruction));
```

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Rust:** Stable channel, version 1.70 or newer
* **Cargo:** Rust's package manager

### Running Locally

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monader-dev/monad-volume-bot.git
cd monad-volume-bot
```

Set optional environment variables:

```bash
export BOT_SYMBOL="MONAD/USDT"
export BOT_API_KEY="<YOUR_EXCHANGE_API_KEY>"
export BOT_SECRET="<YOUR_EXCHANGE_SECRET_KEY>"
```

Run the bot:

```bash
cargo run
```

The bot will initialize, sync, and start its periodic tick cycle, logging market data and potential trade signals to the console.
